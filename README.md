# Arukanoido
A remake of Arkanoid in 2.5D made in the Unreal Engine 4.27 with Blueprints, No C++ required.
Sounds and background patterns from the original have been used, from Spriters Resource and Sounds Resource, and are NOT meant for commercial application. They will have to be removed/replaced if you want to use this as a commercial project of any kind.

I created this project to learn programming with Unreal Blueprints, and wanted it to be as exact to the original as possible. I have since abandoned the project, as I was happy with the 'demo' that I created for it. I am now making it available to the public, to do with as they please. It is licensed as "GNU Affero General Public License v3.0", so that anyone can work with it, but not change the work license. Open source matters!

If you would like to contribute to the project in any way, feel free to. Any improvements submitted will be carefully looked at and considered.

I have since incorporated what I learned from this project, and others, into an Unreal Marketplace Asset - that is designed to make any classic arcade game easier to produce. This is possible due to all of the core functionality of the classic arcade game model, such as; a scoreboard with 2-player (local) capability, basic enemies and game rules mechanics, along with several example games that I built using the system. The latest update of the marketplace system will include a version of this project, redone to fit the system I created, and made custom - from scratch and all with my own created assets.

Finally, thanks to all who download, work with, and support my endeavors!
